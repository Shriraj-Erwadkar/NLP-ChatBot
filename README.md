# Implementation of Chatbot by using NLP
# Overview
This project is an AI-powered chatbot that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to understand and respond to user queries intelligently. The chatbot recognizes different intents and provides relevant responses using NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) for text processing and scikit-learn for training a simple machine learning model.

# Features
- ✅ NLP-based text processing using NLTK 
- ✅ Intent recognition to classify user input
- ✅ Predefined responses for different intents
- ✅ Machine Learning-based response prediction
- ✅ Interactive console-based chatbot
- ✅ Easily customizable intents and responses
  
# Technologies Used
- Python 🐍
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
- Scikit-learn (TF-IDF Vectorizer & Logistic Regression)

# Future Enhancements
🔹 Integrate with Speech-to-Text (STT) and Text-to-Speech (TTS)

🔹 Deploy as a Web App using Flask or Streamlit

🔹 Train with Deep Learning (RNN/LSTM) for better accuracy

🔹 Add real-time API integration (e.g., Weather API, News API)
